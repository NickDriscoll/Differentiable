This is a context-free grammar for the custom language
used to store level data.

This cfg is a little sloppy, but anything between angle brackets is a literal including those brackets.



level        ----> { AABB | MovingObject | Player | Comment }

AABB         ----> <AABB> pair pair </AABB>

MovingObject ----> <MovingObject> pair texturepath bool </MovingObject>

Player       ----> <Player> pair texturepath bool </Player>

Comment      ----> ! [any string, this is ignored by the tokenizer] !

texturepath  ----> [file path to texture]

pair         ----> digitList digitList

digitList    ----> digit { digitList }

digit        ----> 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9

bool         ----> 1 | 0
